            <h2 class="top">You don't want to learn to code.</h2>
            <h1 class="nice">You want to create, make, build something.</h1>
            <p class="first">Unfortunately, that's not the first thing that happens. You want to bring your idea for life, and feel coding is the best way to do it. However, you're probably stuck, learning some terms, whose importance, or relevance to your project is not apparent. <em>Whoops!</em></p>
            <p class="learning"><span>That's not the way learning works.</span> The best way to learn is by doing, and not by watching someone else making things, or learning how you <em>will</em> make things.<br><strong>Just do it.</strong></p>
            <p class="skepticism">Avoid, and be skeptical about learning resources that give you lots of words, and no play. Coding is about playing. Don't learn to make projects, learn <em>by</em> making projects. Find a community, share projects, and talk to like-minded people. You'll enjoy every step.</p>
            <p class="end-pep">That's it for the pep talk. Now go build things. Make your projects. When you don't understand something, google. When you're bored, join a community, and talk to people. Stay inspired.<br></p>
